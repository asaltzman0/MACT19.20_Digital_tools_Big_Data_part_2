# Non-traditional or unstructured data sources
## API and web scrapers 
Web data sources have grown exponentially in the latest decades. Multiple technologies have been developed to simplify access to these sources.

In this folder you can find the following resources:

* An example for using the [Foursquare API](Foursquare_API) that uses a regular grid to call the API recursively.
* A set of "Spiders" for the [Scrapy Library](TripAdvisor_scrapy) to extract data from TripAdvisor.
